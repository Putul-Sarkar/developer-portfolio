<h3>Hey! My name is putul sarkar. I am a web developer.</h3>
<p>I have sbeen working as a frelance web designer and front-end developer.
    Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design in college, I
    realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a
    bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.
